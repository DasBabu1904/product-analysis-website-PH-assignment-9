                The best travel blogs in the world offer amazing travel tips, photography, and video content. Top travel bloggers tend to be passionate writers and storytellers, offering helpful advice and inspiration to get travelers excited to explore new places.
                Travel blogs nowadays are starting to look all the same, with generic off-the-shelf templates, difficult navigation, way too many unnecessary pop-ups and don't get me started on scroll hijacking (why do people do this?).
                This is all good for beginners but when these blogs grow, most bloggers forgot about design and instead doubled down on SEO and marketing, sometimes sacrificing user experience for profit. Their identities are diluted over time and hence why most of the travel blogs you see nowadays feel similar to one another.
